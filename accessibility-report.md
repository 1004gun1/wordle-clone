### Principles of Universal Design

#### 1. **Equitable Use**
**Question:** How does your program adhere to the principle of equitable use?  
**Answer:** Our program currently uses color-coded feedback (green, yellow, and gray) to indicate letter accuracy. 
To ensure accessibility for users with color blindness, we could implement features like customizable color schemes or 
add textual cues alongside colors. This would provide an equitable experience for all users, regardless of their visual 
abilities.

#### 2. **Flexibility in Use**
**Question:** How does your program adhere to the principle of flexibility in use?  
**Answer:** The current input method is keyboard-based. In the future, we could add alternative input methods, 
such as mouse selection or voice commands, allowing users with different preferences or motor impairments to interact 
with the program more comfortably. This flexibility would make the game more inclusive.

#### 3. **Simple and Intuitive Use**
**Question:** How does your program adhere to the principle of simple and intuitive use?  
**Answer:** The interface is simple: users enter letters, and feedback is visually provided. Additionally, 
we have a **instructions page** that guides new players through the game mechanics, making it easy for 
beginners to understand without prior experience. This ensures that users can quickly grasp the gameplay, 
enhancing the overall user experience. In the future we could provide a video tutorial for extra guidance.

#### 4. **Perceptible Information**
**Question:** How does your program adhere to the principle of perceptible information?  
**Answer:** Currently, our program relies solely on visual color cues for feedback. To improve accessibility, 
we could introduce auditory cues or textual descriptions such as "Correct Position" or "Correct Letter," making 
the game more perceptible to users with visual impairments or color blindness.

#### 5. **Tolerance for Error**
**Question:** How does your program adhere to the principle of tolerance for error?  
**Answer:** Currently, incorrect guesses are marked without additional feedback. While features like undo or 
hints could enhance tolerance for error, implementing them would go against the core challenge of the game, which 
relies on users learning from their mistakes and improving with each attempt. Therefore, this principle is 
less applicable in our case as it would compromise the intended difficulty and strategic nature of the game.

#### 6. **Low Physical Effort**
**Question:** How does your program adhere to the principle of low physical effort?  
**Answer:** The program requires minimal physical effort, as input is limited to keyboard typing. To further reduce 
effort, especially for users with motor disabilities, we could introduce larger buttons for touchscreen devices or 
voice command support, enabling easier interaction with the game.

#### 7. **Size and Space for Approach and Use**
**Question:** How does your program adhere to the principle of size and space for approach and use?  
**Answer:** The current grid layout is optimized for desktop use. To accommodate different device sizes, we could 
implement responsive design features that adjust the layout for mobile and tablet screens, ensuring all users can 
comfortably interact with the game regardless of their device.

### Marketing Strategy

**Question:** Who would you market your program towards if you were to sell or license it?  
**Answer:** Our program would be marketed towards **casual gamers** who enjoy word puzzles, including **students, 
educators, and language learners** seeking a fun, educational tool. It could also attract **families** looking for a 
shared recreational activity and **puzzle enthusiasts** who enjoy daily brain challenges. By offering customization 
options and accessibility features, we could appeal to a broad audience with diverse preferences and needs.

### Potential Exclusion of Certain Demographics

**Question:** Is your program less likely to be used by certain demographics?  
**Answer:** Certain demographics, such as **non-native speakers** or individuals with **visual and motor impairments**,
may find the game less accessible without additional support. Language barriers could make the game challenging for 
non-fluent users, and the lack of screen readers or alternative input methods may exclude users with disabilities. 
Addressing these issues through added accessibility features would align with ethical considerations, ensuring broader 
inclusivity and equitable access.
